          Having to lean on complex problems and find creative solutions is what I enjoy the most about becoming an engineer. For the moment, my main interest is developing web applications and cloud computing technologies. 
          I have strong social skills; I bring positivity and organisation to any team I am part of and love to see individuals grow as we work on a project.</p>
